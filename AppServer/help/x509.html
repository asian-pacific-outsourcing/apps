<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>For secure operation, the <I>Application Server</I> authenticates itself
  to clients using <I>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</I> credentials in the
  form of <I>X509Certificates</I>.  You must create the server's credentials
  before attempting to run the server or clients with the
  <A HREF="cmdline.html">x509 command line option</A>.</P>

<P>The server is currently hardcoded to look for its credentials in
   a file called <I>"testkeys"</I>. This file must be placed in the
   same directory as the server's jar file.</I></P>

<P>The easiest way to create the SSL/TLS credentials is to use the
   Java <I>keytool</I>. The keytool.exe program is found in the
   <I>bin</I> subdirectory of the JDK installation directory. A
   shortcut may be created to this program, or the directory may
   be placed in the machine's <I>path variable</I>. An example follows.

<H2>Creating an X509 Certificate</H2>
<P>This example shows how to create credentials for a site,
   <B>"spank.apo.com"</B> owned by <I>Asia Pacific Outsourcing</I>,
   located in Hong Kong. Obviously these values need to change!!
