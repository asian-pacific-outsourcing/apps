<H2>Overview</H2>
<P><B><I>Server</I></B> is configurable <I>at start up</I> to
 run in various modes. Each mode may optionally be run with
 <A HREF="x509.html">X509 certificates</A>. These modes along
 with their run() methods are listed below.</P>

  <P>The "B*" modes use classic blocking I/O:  in other words, calls to
     read()/write() will not return until the I/O operation has completed.
  </P>
  <P>The "N*" modes are non-blocking, employing <I>selectors</I> to
     determine which Channels are ready to perform I/O.
  </P>

 <H2>Blocking Modes</H2>
   <P>Following a successful accept(), the "B*" variants each create a
      RequestServicer object to perform the actual request/reply operations.
      The primary differences between the different "B*" servers is how the
      RequestServicer is actually run:

    B1: RequestServicer.run() is directly called.
    BN:	 A new thread is started, and the thread calls RequestServicer.run().
    BP: A ThreadPool is created, and the pool framework is given Runnable
	tasks to complete.

   <H3>B1 <I>Blocking/Single-threaded Server</I></H3>
    <P>A blocking/single-threaded server which completely services
       each connection before moving to the next.
    </P>
    <PRE>
   public void runServer() throws Exception
      {
      while (true)
         {
         SocketChannel sc = ssc.accept();

         ChannelIO cio = (sslContext != null ?
            ChannelIOSecure.getInstance( sc, true /* blocking */, sslContext)
            : ChannelIO.getInstance( sc, true /* blocking */));

         RequestServicer svc = new RequestServicer(cio);
         svc.run();
         }
      }
    </PRE>
   <H3>BN <I>Blocking/Multi-threaded Server</I></H3>
    <P>A Blocking/Multi-threaded Server which creates a new thread for each
       connection.  This is not efficient for large numbers of connections.
    </P>
    <PRE>
   public void runServer() throws IOException
      {
      while (true)
         {
         SocketChannel sc = ssc.accept();

         ChannelIO cio = (sslContext != null ?
            ChannelIOSecure.getInstance( sc, true /* blocking */, sslContext)
          :   ChannelIO.getInstance( sc, true /* blocking */));

         RequestServicer svc = new RequestServicer(cio);
         Thread th = new Thread(svc);
         th.start();
         }
      }
    </PRE>
   <H3>BP <I>Blocking/Pooled-Thread Server</I></H3>
    <P>A multi-threaded server which creates a pool of threads for use
       by the server. The Thread pool decides how to schedule those
       threads.
    </P>
    <PRE>
   public void runServer() throws Exception
      {
      ExecutorService xec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(
       Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * POOL_MULTIPLE);

      while (true)
         {
         SocketChannel sc = ssc.accept();

         ChannelIO cio = (sslContext != null ?
            ChannelIOSecure.getInstance( sc, true /* blocking */, sslContext)
          :   ChannelIO.getInstance( sc, true /* blocking */));

         RequestServicer svc = new RequestServicer(cio);
         xec.execute(svc);
         }
      }
    </PRE>

 <H2>Nonblocking Modes</H2>
   <H3>N1</B>   Nonblocking/Single-threaded Server</I></H3>
    <P>A non-blocking/single-threaded server.  All accept() and
       read()/write() operations are performed by a single thread, but
       only after being selected for those operations by a Selector.
    </P>
    <PRE>
   public void runServer() throws Exception
      {
      Dispatcher d = new Dispatcher1();
      d.register(ssc, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT, new AcceptHandler(ssc, d, sslContext));
      d.run();
      }
    </PRE>
   <H3>N2</B>   Nonblocking/Dual-threaded Server</I></H3>
    <P>A non-blocking/dual-threaded which performs accept()s in one
       thread and services requests in a second.
    </P>
    <PRE>
   public void runServer() throws Exception
      {
      Dispatcher d = new DispatcherN();
      Acceptor a = new Acceptor(ssc, d, sslContext);
      new Thread(a).start();
      d.run();
      }
