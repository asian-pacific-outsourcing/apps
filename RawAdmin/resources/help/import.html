<P>The <B><I>Import</I></B> tab presents an interface to specify a csv file to import
  and to supply default values for any missing columns in the CSV file.
  <BR><B>Note:</B> This screen incorporates <I>Drag and Drop</I> technology when
  available from the operating system, so in general, it's easiest to just drag
  individual files onto the import panel and drop them to initiate the import.
  However, <B>only import one file at time!</B></P>

<P>As the importer reads each line of the csv file it creates a new contact record in
  the database if the record is unique and valid. More specifically, the importer
  follows these steps:
  <OL>
   <LI>To check the file:
    <UL>
     <LI>Opens the file to make sure it exists and is readable.</LI>
     <LI>Reads the first line to ensure that the column headers supplied
       match the expected column headers.<BR> <B>Note:</B> The columns must
       be in the expected order. Furthermore, at least the first 9 columns
       must be present (<I>id</I> through <I>WebSite</I>; the remaining
       columns can use default values. However, if any of the optional
       columns are specified, then all expected columns to the left of
       the optional column must be present.</LI>
     <LI>Reads the entire file to count the lines.</LI>
     <LI>Closes the file and reopens it for processing.</LI>
     <LI>Connects to the database in exclusive mode and determines the
       next available contact id number.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
   <LI>To process each line:
    <UL>
     <LI>Reads one line skipping over any nonprinable characters.</LI>
     <LI>Parses the individual fields checking for the correct data type,
        and verifying that required fields are not blank. Data is also
        converted to internal format (proper, dates, lookups, etc). Any
        errors cause the line to be rejected, and the importer skips to
        the next line.</LI>
     <LI>Insets default values into any blank but not required fields.</LI>
     <LI>Ensures that at least one phone number has been supplied. If not,
        this line is rejected, and the importer goes on to the next line.</LI>
     <LI>Compares the new name and phone numbers with existing names and
        and numbers and rejects any exact matches as duplicates.</LI>
     <LI>Compares the new name and company with existing names and companies.
        Any very similar values are dispositioned as <I>potential duplicates</I>
        for subsequent manual processing via the <B><I>Raw Disposition</I></B>
        application.</LI>
     <LI>Assigns the new data a unique <I>id</I>, inserts it into the database
        then proceeds to the next line in the file.</LI>.
    </UL></LI>
   <LI>To clean up:
    <UL>
     <LI>Disconnects from the database.</LI>
     <LI>Closes the csv file.</LI>
     <LI>Logs statistics including counts of lines read, errors encountered,
       and duplicates rejected, as well as the actual time required.</LI>
    </UL></LI></OL></P>
