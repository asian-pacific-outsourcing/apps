      <p><font size="6">-The purpose of this first trade is to <strong>earn</strong> your trust so we can move on to larger and more profitable positions.<br />
        <br />
        -I know you see the profit potential but you’re letting your fear of something new cloud your judgment and get in the way of you <strong>making money.</strong><br />
        <br />
        -Everyone knows the <strong>key to making money</strong> in the markets is price and timing! That’s why I’m calling you <strong>today</strong> on ____.<br />
        <br />
        -<strong>News</strong> moves markets <strong>anticipatio</strong>n makes a stock climb higher!<br />
        <br />
        -In order for you to make an educated business decision, you need to have all the <strong>facts</strong> in front of you fresh in your mind.<br />
        <br />
        -Almost all of my clients started out with the same questions and concerns, but what they found after our <strong>first trade</strong> was that everything was answered with <strong>proven results</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        -Another email isn’t going to make you any money, <strong>I am</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        -Our business is like your business, we’re always looking for more clients!<br />
        <br />
        -Most of my clients have started the same way, having little or no experience in the markets. <strong>That’s ok</strong>! <strong>My job</strong> is to guide and advise you every step of the way.<br />
        <br />
        -Its human nature to be nervous when starting something new. That’s why I recommend we start <strong>small</strong>, before moving on to <strong>bigger</strong> business.<br />
        <br />
        -If I don’t impress you, close your account and don’t do anymore business with me. But when I out perform any other investments you have, I will expect <strong>more</strong> and <strong>larger</strong> business in the future.-<br />
        <br />
        -I know you weren’t expecting my call today. If I could have called you months ago and told you to expect my call I would have, but unfortunately that’s not the way the markets work.<br />

        <u>Softening Statements</u><br />
        <br />      
        <strong><em><u>*ALWAYS begin a stroke/rebuttal with a softening statement*</u></em></strong><br />
        <br />
        - I can appreciate that…<br />
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="6">- I understand your view point… </font></p>
      <font size="6">
      <p>-I don’t blame you for feeling that way…</p>
      <p>-Many people felt just as you do…</p>
      <p>-Yes, I agree…</p>
      <p>-You no doubt have good reason for feeling that way…</p>
      <p>-That is a perfectly natural thought…</p>
      <p>-I can see why at first glance you would think that…<br />
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><u>Not Interested</u></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>I can appreciate your not interested at this time right now, but if you can give me a few moments of your time, <strong>RIGHT NOW,</strong> you’ll have all the information to base your decision on and we can part ways professionally. <strong>Is that fair enough?</strong><br />
            <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I’m not trying to convince you to do something you don’t want to do. All I’m looking for is a few minutes and an open mind. If you like what I have to say, great, maybe we’ll do business! If not, then we’ll simply part as professionals. <strong>That’s fair, right!</strong><br />
            <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>From one business man to another, if someone presents me with a profitable business opportunity I at least here them out. The information I’m going to share with you is free. Take a few moments to decide if it’s for you. Not on a personal level but on a business level. <strong>OK</strong>?      <br />
            <br />
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>It sounds to me like you may have had a bad experience in the past. Is that correct? <strong><u>(If yes)</u></strong> I’m sorry to hear that, allow me to explain what we have and if it’s not for you that’s fine, we won’t contact you again.  <strong>(If no)</strong> What is it you have against listening to a profitable business idea?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><br />
        If still saying no…</strong><br />
        <br />
        This type of investing isn’t for everyone (1st name), clearly it’s not for you. I have a lot of people to speak with today so we’ll go ahead and part as professionals. Have a great day!</p>
